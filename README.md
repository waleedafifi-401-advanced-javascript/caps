# caps

CAPS Phase 1: Begin the build of an application for a company called CAPS - The Code Academy Parcel Service. In this sprint, weâ€™ll build out a system that emulates a real world supply chain. 
CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such a Cacti shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, be notified that their customers received what they purchased.
